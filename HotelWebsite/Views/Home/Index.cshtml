    <div class="home-about-text">
        <p>Our hotel is located in the heart of the beautiful Belgian city of Bruges. 
           You can easily lie low here, sometimes going out to admire the local sights and architecture. 
           Plunge into the heart of the High and late Middle Ages in comfortable and high-tech rooms of our hotel. 
           Within walking distance of restaurants, cafes, bars and other places for leisure.</p>

        <p>Bruges, the capital of West Flanders in northwest Belgium, is distinguished by its canals, 
           cobbled streets and medieval buildings. Its port, Zeebrugge, is an important center 
           for fishing and European trade. In the city center’s Burg square, the 14th-century Stadhuis (City Hall) 
           has an ornate carved ceiling. Nearby, Markt square features a 13th-century belfry 
           with a 47-bell carillon and 83m tower with panoramic views.</p>

        <p>The city lies 17 km from the seashore, in a fertile plain, on the line
           of the Ghent—Ostend state railway. Three canals connect in the city — Ghent, Sluis and Ostend;
           these canals are so deep that large sea vessels can walk on them. 
           Sometimes Bruges is called the "Venice of the North". 
           In ancient times, people gathered here at the bridge for fairs, the name of the locality "Bridge" 
           became a household name and passed to the formed city (Dutch Brugge is traditionally erected to it. 
           Brücke bridge). There are 54 bridges in the modern city, of which 12 are wooden and drawbridges 
           for passing ships.</p>
